# Code Documentation

The following documents the source code of TsGui. Note that this is a work in progress because:

1.  I currently maintain this project on my own so this documentation is primarily for myself
2.  This project has grown much larger than originally anticipated, so in most cases I am retrospectively doing documentation I didn't think I'd need.

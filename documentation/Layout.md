## Overview
TsGui is built around a grid structure with rows and columns similar to an HTML table.

## Page
A TsGui UI contains one or more pages. Each page is contained within a ```<Page>``` element, and can contain one or more [rows](#row). If more than one page exists, TsGui will automatically configure the Next/Previous buttons appropriately. 


## Row

## Column

## Container

## GuiOptions
The actual control and text elements in the UI are created using GuiOptions. Refer to the GuiOption [documentation](/documentation/options/README.md) for more details.

# Heading

The **Heading** GuiOption is a simple text label. It does not contain a separate UI element, and doesn't set a value in the output i.e. it doesn't create a Task Sequence Variable. 


```xml
<GuiOption Type="Heading">
    <Label>Additional Applications</Label>
    <Bold />
</GuiOption>
```

# TsGui

TsGui is a little application to use with Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager a.k.a. SCCM or ConfigMgr.

TsGui aims to remove the overhead involved with using HTAs in your SCCM task sequences, while retaining all their advantages. The program creates a custom GUI built from a relatively simple XML file, and can be setup, tested, and deployed in less than 30 minutes. Note that this setup requires no scripting knowledge. The simplicity allows the maintenance of the GUI to be moved to more junior engineers, or just makes your life easier.

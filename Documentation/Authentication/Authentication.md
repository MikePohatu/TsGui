# Authentication

Authentication is used to restrict further progress within TsGui, and to provide authentication credentials to external systems e.g. Active Directory.

It should be noted that there are limitations to what is possible in WinPE due to a only a limited subset of the .Net Framework being avaiable. For this reason Active Directory Authentication is considered as a beta feature and requires WinPE customisation that will not be supported by Microsoft.
